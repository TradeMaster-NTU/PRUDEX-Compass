# Performance Profile
The performance profile reports FinRL methods' score distribution of all runs across the differentfinancial markets that are statistically unbiased and more robust to outliers.

We design 2 sets of the colors for better visulization. You can alter the color option by modiying the definition of colors and run the `distrbution.py`.

For the first option, the `color` definition is  as followed.
```
colors = [
    'moccasin', 'aquamarine', '#dbc2ec', 'orchid', 'lightskyblue', 'pink',
    'orange'
]
```
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PRUDEX-Compass-948C/Compass/pictures/overall_13.svg" width = 400 height =  />
</div>

For the second option, the `color` definition is  as followed.
```
colors = sns.color_palette("Accent")
```
